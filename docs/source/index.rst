Welcome to hydra-python-agent's documentation!
==============================================

hydra-python-agent is a `smart Hydra client <http://www.hydra-cg.com/>`__ implemented in 
Python which works with hydrus. Reference implementation is 
`Heracles.ts <https://github.com/HydraCG/Heracles.ts>`__. Smart clients are generic automated clients 
that establish resilient connected data networks leveraging
knowledge graphs.

agent module
------------
The agent is used in order to:
   1. Provide a seamless Client that can be used to communicate with Hydra APIs.
   2. Cache metadata from the Hydra server it connects to, to allow querying on the client-side.
   3. Maintain a syncrhonization mechanism which makes sure cached resources are consistent.
   4. The graph can be queried using OpenCypher.

The agent module contains a main Agent class. The agent module uses a redis caching layer to store 
the generated apidoc and allow efficient querying.  
This class inherits classes from the socketio module and the Session class from the requests module.
This class is first initialized with the main entrypoint url.
(Example) In this case, the entrypoint_url is "http://localhost:8080/serverapi".
A connection to the redis server is initialized using the redis modules (present in the redis_core files) 
and a connection with the hydrus server is established at the entrypoint url provided using socketio.
 
The Agent class has various functions. Some commonly used functions are explained below:

1) fetch_apidoc()
    This function is used to generate the apidoc for the entrypoint_url initialized and the name of the api
    which is extracted from the entrypoint_url. This apidoc is generated by passing the apidoc present in hydrus
    through the doc_maker module from hydra-python-core.
2) get()
    This function is used to handle a GET request to the url mentioned as a parameter. The function returns an apidoc
    for the respective resource from the redis graph in a JSON format.
    
3) post()
    This function is used to handle a POST request to the url mentioned as a parameter. It is used to update the resource at the specified 
    url. 
    
4) put()
    This function is used to handle a PUT request to the url mentioned as a parameter. It is used to add a resource at the specified url.
    
The final goal is to create a Client that can connected to multiple hydrus servers and operate between them while caching information in 
a graph-based database(Redis). 
This should enable the client to have an "aggregated view" of the connected network (the network of all the servers it connects to) and 
make complex sematic queries to it.

Usage
-----

For the installation process, click `here <https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydra-python-agent#installation>`__

1. Initializing the Agent:

.. code-block:: python

   from hydra_agent.agent import Agent
   agent = Agent("http://localhost:8080/serverapi")

2. To *GET* a resource:

a) To get a collection, the syntax is

.. code-block:: python
   
   agent.get("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/<CollectionType>/")

Example:

.. code-block:: python
   
   agent.get("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/MovieCollection")

Output:
   Returns the ApiDoc for the resource MovieCollection 

b) To get members of a specific collection, the syntax is

.. code-block:: python
   
   agent.get("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/<CollectionType>/<Collection-ID>")

c) To get members of a specific resource, the syntax is

.. code-block:: python
   
   agent.get("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/<ResourceType>/<Resource-ID>")

3. To add a new resource using a *PUT* request:
   
   Syntax

.. code-block:: python
   
   agent.post("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/<ResourceType>/<Resource-ID>,<new_property>")

.. code-block:: python
   
   new_resource={
      "@type" : "Movie",
      "movie_name" : "The Shawshank Redemption",
   }
   agent.put("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/Movie/", new_resource)

4. To update a resource using a *POST* request:
   
   Syntax

.. code-block:: python
   
   agent.post("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/<ResourceType>/<Resource-ID>,<updated_property>")

.. code-block:: python
   
   existing_resource["movie_name"] = "The Green Mile"
   agent.post("http://localhost:8080/serverapi/Movie/", existing_resource)
